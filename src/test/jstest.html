<span class="baffle">I don't think I ever consciously chose between a career and a family, but deep down I'd always thought my research would be my legacy. I certainly wouldn't be counting down the days until I ride a pillar of fire into orbit if I hadn't made sacrifices for my work; I'd always hoped not be remembered in flesh and blood, fading memory and recycled anecdote, but immortalised in the annals of science.

But even science's memory fades over time. Copernicus, Newton, Einstein, Watson and Crick, d'Aquin: their contributions were significant enough to become history. Such fame may be aspiration beyond my field, yet if everything goes to plan - if our funding holds out, if Project Odyssey goes ahead with no major setbacks, if the Quanta-177 precursor lives up to our expectations - something I helped create will still be out there in a thousand years, heading for the stars. I can hardly bear the weight of expectation on my shoulders; without a suitable AI, Odyssey will never leave orbit. This is our big chance to send humanity to another solar system.

I just don't want to be the one to screw it up.</span>
